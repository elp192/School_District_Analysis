# School District Analysis
## Project Overview
### Background
The Input Data file consists of [student_complete.csv](https://github.com/elp192/School_District_Analysis/blob/848b49cf0e2d54259f47046b611cac713bee394e/Inputs%20Data/students_complete.csv) and [school_complete.csv](https://github.com/elp192/School_District_Analysis/blob/848b49cf0e2d54259f47046b611cac713bee394e/Inputs%20Data/schools_complete.csv), which include information about 15 schools and 39170 students. The students are at their 9th-12th grade level. In these files, students' math and reading scores and their gender are provided. Analysis of these datasets helps the school board to make an appropriate decision about school budgets and priorities.<br>
### Purpose
The main aim of this project is aggregating data to determine the school performance using math scores, reading scores, and other information that is available about school.<br>
Python (version 3.8.8) is used as the coding language, and the code is written in Jupyter Notebook. Also, Pandas library (version 1.3.0) and Numpy library (version 1.21.0) are utilized in this project.<br>
## Results<br>
Ù‘The school board finds out dishonesty for the math and reading scores of ninth-graders studied at Thomas High School. To present the standard test scores, these grades should be replaced by NAN values while the rest of the data is kept intact.<br> 
The analysis of the modified database can be categorized as follows:<br>1. District summary, 2. School district summary, 3. Performance of top 5 and bottom 5 schools, 4. The average math and reading scores for 9th-12th graders and each school, 5. The scores that are grouped by: school spending per student, school size, and school type.<br>
